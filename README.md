# how-sweet-it-is

This repository contains a project I worked on looking at classification of images. I chose to classify food images as "sweet" or "not sweet".

The dataset I started with is the food-101 dataset (https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) that contains 101,000 images of food divided into 101 categories such as apple pie, pizza and sushi. Each category contains 1000 images. 

How Sweet It Is To Be Classified By You.pdf is a pdf of the presentation I made about the project.

The app directory contains the code and requirements to build a flask app that allows you to upload an image and have it classified as "sweet" or "not sweet".

The code directory contains all the ipython notebooks I used for the project, including the one I used on Amazon Web Services for neural net training and all the notebooks I used in my exploratory data analysis.
